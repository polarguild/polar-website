# < POLAR >

Official placeholder website for the POLAR MMO guild.

## Technology

This is a single-page static site built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks. No backend. No routing. No database. Just fast and minimal.

## Deployment

All changes pushed to `main` are automatically deployed to [polarguild.org](https://polarguild.org) via GitHub Pages.

> Domain forwarding to Squarespace is handled outside this repo.

## Current Status

This is a temporary public-facing site until a designer joins the project or a full site is built.  
It's meant to act as a lightweight info hub and landing page.
